* North East Market: it's on [2101 E Monument St](https://goo.gl/maps/Cy7K5LJ3pZx9p3Mr5) which is just a few minutes away walking. You can find a lot of variety there including a korean stall at the south end of the market.
* School of Public Health 9th floor salad bar [Garden Plate](https://www.yelp.com/biz/garden-plate-baltimore): walk two blocks north to [615 N Wolfe St](https://goo.gl/maps/E5yJzcK4EA4mdTB89), then take an elevator on the south side of the building to the 9th floor. The elevators on the north side don't go all the way up to the 9th floor.
